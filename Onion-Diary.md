By far, the basic encodig-decoding algorithm eclib has already been developed (cauchy rs coder and cauchy rs coder will be improved by He). Eclib will provide encoding and decoding service for master. Some work will be done next week:

- Test eclib;
- Read java-jerasure and jerasure to enhance eclib.
- Read tachyon and hdfs code base, and then design the framework of master/work/network module.
